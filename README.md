### Side notes (read to know why I made this)
I made this because every week, my dad hands me a stack of DHL shipment papers and asks me to download the proof of delivery. He runs a business that also handles logistics, so this is a regular occurrence. Since Iâ€™m lazy, I built this app to make my life easier. Itâ€™s made for a super niche purpose, but heyâ€”if you were curious, now you know.
